# Codex Security CLI FAQ

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Find answers to common questions about scanning repositories and managing
security findings from the terminal. For installation and a first scan, start
with the [CLI quickstart](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli).

## Repository scans

### Who can use the CLI

The Codex Security CLI and SDK are in limited beta. Approved customers and
partners receive installation instructions with their access. Contact your
account team if you need access.

### Why does a scan use an API key after sign-in

When your environment includes `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `CODEX_API_KEY`, scans
without an interactive terminal and JSON and JSONL scans use the environment
API key by default, even after a successful ChatGPT or access-token login.
Interactive scans with text output ask you to choose when a ChatGPT sign-in is
also available. Dry runs don't prompt or load credentials.

To use your stored credentials for a scan, select them explicitly:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --auth chatgpt
```

To make your stored credentials the automatic default, run
`unset OPENAI_API_KEY CODEX_API_KEY`. For all supported authentication modes,
see the [CLI reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/reference#select-scan-authentication).

### How does bulk repository scanning work

Sign in with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Discover and select repositories from a GitHub account or organization:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan
```

For a prepared list, provide a repository CSV and an output directory:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan repositories.csv \
  --output-dir /path/outside/repositories/security-scans \
  --workers 4
```

See [Run bulk security scans](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/bulk-scans) for GitHub
discovery, the CSV format, campaign results, and available options.

### Can an interrupted bulk scan resume

Yes. Run the same bulk-scan command with the original CSV and output directory.
Codex Security skips completed repositories when their recorded scan artifacts
remain intact.

Add `--max-attempts 3` to retry temporary repository or scan errors:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security bulk-scan repositories.csv \
  --output-dir /path/outside/repositories/security-scans \
  --workers 4 \
  --max-attempts 3
```

### How can a scan use architecture and security policies

Pass architecture documents, threat models, or security policies with
`--knowledge-base`:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . \
  --knowledge-base /path/to/architecture.md \
  --knowledge-base /path/to/security-policies
```

Codex Security uses these documents as context for the current scan. For
supported file types and directory behavior, see [Add security
context](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/reference#add-security-context).

## Findings and coverage

### Where can teams find earlier scan results

List saved scans for your repository:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans list /path/to/repository
```

Use a scan ID from the results to inspect its findings:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans show SCAN_ID
```

Each completed scan keeps its report, findings, coverage, and supporting
artifacts together. See [Scan
artifacts](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/reference#scan-artifacts) for the full layout.

### How do scans distinguish new and known findings

Match findings that share a root cause across the two scans:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans match PREVIOUS_SCAN_ID CURRENT_SCAN_ID
```

Compare the matched findings:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans compare PREVIOUS_SCAN_ID CURRENT_SCAN_ID
```

The comparison identifies new, persisting, reopened, resolved, and unknown
findings. A finding counts as resolved only when the later scan covers its
original target and affected path without coverage gaps.

### How does false-positive feedback work

Inspect the saved scan to find the occurrence ID:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans show SCAN_ID
```

Record why that finding doesn't apply:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security findings mark-false-positive FINDING_OCCURRENCE_ID \
  --reason "The framework escapes this input before it reaches the query"
```

Future scans of the same repository receive that explanation as context. They
still independently check the current source, controls, and reachability. A
dismissal doesn't suppress a rule, path, or vulnerability class.

For command details, see the [findings
reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/reference#codex-security-findings).

### Why can repeat scans return different findings

AI-assisted scans can vary, even with the same scan configuration. Start by
rerunning your baseline scan:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans rerun BASELINE_SCAN_ID
```

Match the baseline findings to the new scan:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans match BASELINE_SCAN_ID REPEAT_SCAN_ID
```

Compare the matched results:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans compare BASELINE_SCAN_ID REPEAT_SCAN_ID
```

Provide shared architecture and security guidance when missing context may
contribute to the variation. Matching can identify the same underlying finding
across runs, but it doesn't make scans deterministic. Directly recheck any
important finding that disappears.

### How can a team confirm that a fix worked

After applying a fix, rerun the original scan:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans rerun BEFORE_SCAN_ID
```

Match the original findings to the new scan:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans match BEFORE_SCAN_ID AFTER_SCAN_ID
```

Compare the matched findings:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scans compare BEFORE_SCAN_ID AFTER_SCAN_ID
```

Confirm that the new scan covers the original target and affected path without
coverage gaps. Then directly recheck the original finding against the current
checkout:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security validate /path/to/original/findings.json \
  "Recheck the SQL injection in src/orders.ts:42 against the current code"
```

A missing finding or scan comparison alone doesn't prove that a fix worked.

### What does incomplete coverage mean

Coverage can be `complete`, `partial`, or `unknown`. Review `coverage.json`
for excluded paths, deferred surfaces, and open questions before treating a
scan as evidence of review.

Scans with partial or unknown coverage return exit code `2`, even without a
severity policy. They still keep any available findings and coverage. A later
scan can't establish that an earlier finding no longer exists when it doesn't
cover that finding's original path.

## Automation and cost

### How do scan cost limits work

Set an estimated cost limit in USD before starting the scan:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . --max-cost 5
```

The limit is an estimate, not a hard spending cap. Requests already in
progress can finish above the limit. Codex Security keeps available results
when the scan stops.

### Can scans check commits and pull requests

Install a pre-commit security check for staged and unstaged changes:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security install-hook
```

For pull-request checks, scan the committed changes and set a severity
threshold:

```bash
npx @openai/codex-security scan . \
  --diff origin/main \
  --fail-on-severity high
```

A complete scan returns exit code `1` when it finds an issue at or above the
selected severity. See [Run scans in CI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/ci) for the
complete GitHub Actions workflow, artifact handling, and SARIF export.

### Can another application run scans directly

Yes. Use the [TypeScript SDK](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/sdk) to start scans, select
targets, inspect findings and coverage, track progress, and apply cost controls
from an application or developer tool.
