# Codex Security

Codex Security reviews code for vulnerabilities and reports evidence you can
use to investigate and fix them. Choose how to run it based on where your code
lives and how you want to review the results.

The **Overview** in Daybreak Defense Factory shows proposed fixes and tracks [open and fixed findings](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/findings-and-fixes) across your repositories.

> Illustration: Daybreak Overview with proposed fixes across three repositories, open findings by severity, and the daily trend for new and fixed findings.

## Choose the next task

After a local scan, review its scope and findings before deciding what to do next.

For automation, use the CLI guides to [scan repositories in
bulk](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/bulk-scans) or [run scans in
CI](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/ci). Look up commands and defaults in the
[CLI reference](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/cli/reference).

Codex Security scans application code. For permissions and sandbox controls
that govern Codex itself, see [Agent approvals and
security](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security).
