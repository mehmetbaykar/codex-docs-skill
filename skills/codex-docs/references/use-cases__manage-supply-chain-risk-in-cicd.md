# Manage supply chain risk in the CI/CD

Investigate dependency alerts and check package updates for security risks.

Assess how third-party dependencies affect your application’s security with Codex Security CLI. Triage and validate Dependabot alerts, and run security scans when packages are introduced or updated.

## Recipe details

```yaml
name: Manage supply chain risk in the CI/CD
tagline: Investigate dependency alerts and check package updates for security risks.
summary: Assess how third-party dependencies affect your application’s security
  with Codex Security CLI. Triage and validate Dependabot alerts, and run
  security scans when packages are introduced or updated.
bestFor:
  - Application security teams deciding which dependency alerts require action.
  - Developers assessing newly introduced packages or dependency updates.
  - Platform teams adding dependency-triggered security scans to their CI/CD
    pipelines.

You can leverage the Codex Security CLI to assess dependencies in the codebase, such as when a new dependency is introduced or a version is bumped. This is extremely useful in preventing vulnerable packages from presenting supply chain risk. The way to achieve this is through deploying the Codex Security CLI as commands within custom workflows.

## Validating Dependabot alerts

Codex Security provides a skill for validating existing third-party vulnerabilities, including Dependabot, for reachability and exploitability. You can invoke the skill directly in the UI or through the CLI.

Codex will triage each of the Dependabot alerts and subsequently present a ledger of each presented risk with a reason why the alert was validated or not.

## Running scans when package versions change

It is also possible to run security scans against the latest version of a dependency when the version is changed.

      - package.json
      - package-lock.json
