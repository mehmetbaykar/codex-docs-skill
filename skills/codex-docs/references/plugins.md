# Plugins

## Overview

Plugins bundle capabilities into reusable workflows in ChatGPT. They can
include skills, connectors, or both. Plugins are available in Work mode in
ChatGPT on the web and in Work mode or Codex in the ChatGPT desktop app. Codex
CLI also has a plugin browser for Codex environments. Plugins aren't available
in Chat mode, the IDE extension, or mobile.

In the ChatGPT desktop app, select ChatGPT and switch to Work mode, or select
Codex. Then open **Plugins** to browse, install, and use plugins. Installed
plugins can add skills, connectors, and MCP tools to new chats.

Extend what ChatGPT can do, for example:

- Install the Codex Security plugin to scan authorized code and confirm
  plausible vulnerability findings.
- Install the Gmail plugin to let ChatGPT read and manage Gmail.
- Install the Google Drive plugin to work across Drive, Docs, Sheets, and
  Slides.
- Install the Slack plugin to summarize channels or draft replies.

A plugin can contain one or more of these parts:

- **Skills:** reusable instructions for specific kinds of work. ChatGPT can load
  them when needed so it follows the right steps and uses the right references
  or helper scripts for a task.
- **Connectors:** connections to tools like GitHub, Slack, or Google Drive, so
  ChatGPT can read information from those tools and take actions in them.
  Connectors expose tools and can optionally include custom ChatGPT UI.
- **MCP servers:** services that give ChatGPT access to more tools or shared
  information, often from systems outside your local project. They're also the
  services behind connectors. They define tools, enforce auth, return structured
  data, and perform actions against external systems.
- **Browser extensions:** browser capabilities that a plugin needs for its
  workflow.
- **Hooks:** commands that run at configured lifecycle points. Review and trust
  plugin hooks before you enable them.
- **Scheduled task templates:** reusable starting points for recurring tasks
  where scheduled tasks are available.

You can share plugins by publishing them through a marketplace source, such as a
repo marketplace for a project or team. See [Build plugins](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-plugins)
for marketplace setup, packaging, and distribution guidance.

If you are building an integration, start with [Build an app](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-app).
If the app needs custom ChatGPT UI, use the
[Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk) for that optional UI layer.

## Use and install plugins

### Plugins in ChatGPT

To browse and install curated plugins:

- On the web, switch to Work mode and open **Plugins**.
- In the ChatGPT desktop app, select ChatGPT and switch to Work mode, or select
  Codex. Then open **Plugins**.

The Plugins Directory organizes plugins into tabs:

- **OpenAI:** plugins built by OpenAI.
- **Your workspace name:** plugins provided by your workspace.
- **Personal:** personal marketplace plugins, including **Created by me** and
  **Shared with me** sections when those plugins are available.

Use the separate **Installed** row to review plugins you already installed.

### Install and use a plugin in ChatGPT

Once you open the Plugins Directory:

1. Search or browse for a plugin, then open its details.
2. Select the plus button to install the plugin.
3. If the plugin needs a connector, connect it when prompted. Some plugins
   ask you to authenticate during install. Others wait until the first time you
   use them.
4. After installation, start a new chat and ask ChatGPT to use the plugin.

After you install a plugin, you can use it directly in the prompt window:

    <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-default">Describe the task directly</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-secondary">
      Ask for the outcome you want, such as "Summarize unread Gmail threads
      from today" or "Pull the latest launch notes from Google Drive."
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-secondary">
      Use this when you want ChatGPT to choose the right installed tools for the
      task.
    </p>

    <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-default">Choose a specific plugin</p>
    <p class="mt-2 text-sm text-secondary">
      Type <code>@</code> to invoke the plugin or one of its bundled skills
      explicitly.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3 text-sm text-secondary">
      Use this when you want to be specific about which plugin or skill ChatGPT
      should use. See [Skills & Plugins](https://learn.chatgpt.com/codex/skills-and-plugins).
    </p>

### How permissions and data sharing work

When a plugin capability runs through a Codex host, the host's [sandbox and
approval policy](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/agent-approvals-security) applies.
Connections to external services use that service's own authentication and
access controls.

- Bundled skills become available when you start a new chat or CLI session
  after installation.
- If a plugin includes connectors, ChatGPT may prompt you to install or sign in to
  those connectors in ChatGPT during setup or the first time you use them.
- If a plugin includes MCP servers, they may require extra setup or
  authentication before you can use them.
- When ChatGPT sends data through a bundled connector, that service's terms and privacy
  policy apply.

### Remove a plugin

To remove a plugin, open it from a supported plugin browser and select
**Uninstall plugin** when that action is available. Workspace-installed or
default plugins may not offer that action; your workspace administrator controls
them instead.

Uninstalling a plugin removes the plugin bundle from that ChatGPT or Codex
environment, but bundled connectors stay connected until you manage them in
ChatGPT.

## Build your own plugin

If you want to create, test, or distribute your own plugin, see
[Build plugins](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-plugins). That page covers local scaffolding,
manual marketplace setup, workspace sharing, plugin manifests, and packaging
guidance.

If your plugin includes an app, see [Build an app](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-app). Apps are
MCP-backed integrations. They can work with tools alone, or add custom ChatGPT UI
through the [Apps SDK](https://developers.openai.com/apps-sdk) when a visual surface helps the workflow.

When your plugin is ready for review, see
[Submit plugins](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/submit-plugins) for the OpenAI Platform submission
flow, required permissions, review materials, MCP checks, and test case
requirements.
