# Run a deep security scan

Search an authorized repository deeply for plausible vulnerabilities.

Use the Codex Security plugin to run a more comprehensive audit of a repository or scoped folder that repeats discovery, validates candidates, and produces reviewable findings and coverage.

## Recipe details

```yaml
name: Run a deep security scan
tagline: Search an authorized repository deeply for plausible vulnerabilities.
summary: Use the Codex Security plugin to run a more comprehensive audit of a
  repository or scoped folder that repeats discovery, validates candidates, and
  produces reviewable findings and coverage.
skills:
  - token: $codex-security:deep-security-scan
    url: https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/security/plugin/deep-scans
    description: Run repeated discovery passes over a repository or scoped folder,
      validate surviving findings, analyze attack paths, and report findings and
      coverage.
bestFor:
  - Application security reviews of a repository or component that you own or
    are authorized to assess.
  - More comprehensive reviews where additional runtime and token use are
    appropriate for finding more candidate issues.
  - Security teams that need traceable finding evidence before deciding what to
    remediate.
starterPrompt:
  title: Run a Deep Security Scan
  body: >-
    Use $codex-security:deep-security-scan to run a deep security scan on [this
    repository / absolute path to a scoped folder].

    Scope and rules:

    - I am authorized to assess this repository.

    - Keep the scan within [the entire repository / the exact folder named
    above].

    - Use the Codex Security plugin's deep-scan workflow; do not reinterpret
    this as a pull request or diff review.

    Return the scan directory and report.md path. Summarize the findings,
    reviewed surfaces, and proof gaps that require human review first.

## Choose a deep repository review

Use a deep scan when you need a more comprehensive vulnerability review across
a repository or explicit folder and can budget for a longer run. The Codex
Security plugin repeats discovery passes before validating and prioritizing
findings, so this workflow takes more time and resources than an ordinary scan.

A deep scan can review an entire repository or one explicitly named package or
directory. To review a pull request, commit, branch diff, or working-tree patch,
use
[$codex-security:security-diff-scan](https://developers.openai.com/codex/use-cases/scan-code-changes-for-security).

## Prepare an authorized scan

1. Open the repository in Codex and complete the [Codex Security plugin quickstart](https://developers.openai.com/codex/security/plugin).
2. Confirm that you own the repository or have authorization to assess it.
3. Add architecture, trust-boundary, security-invariant, finding-criteria,
   exclusion, and severity guidance in `SECURITY.md`. Use nested `SECURITY.md`
   files for directory-specific policy.
4. Keep supported build, test, and validation commands and other repository
   instructions in `AGENTS.md`.
5. Run the starter prompt and let the scan complete its repeated discovery,
   validation, attack-path analysis, and final reporting stages.
6. Review the findings workspace, report, and any proof gaps. Request detailed
   vulnerability reports or structural hardening guidance when you need them.

## Review evidence before remediation

The final result should identify affected locations, why the behavior is
reachable, what validation Codex performed, any remaining proof gaps, and a
bounded remediation direction. Distinguish findings without validation evidence
from validated findings.

Start remediation only for a finding you have selected and reviewed. Use
[Remediate a vulnerability backlog](https://developers.openai.com/codex/use-cases/remediate-vulnerability-backlog)
to fix findings one at a time with focused regression validation.
