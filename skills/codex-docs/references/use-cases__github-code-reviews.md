## How to use

Start by adding Codex code review to your GitHub organization or repository.
See [Codex code review in GitHub](https://developers.openai.com/codex/third-party/github) for more details.

You can set up Codex to automatically review every pull request, or you can request a review with `@codex review` in a pull request comment.

If Codex flags a regression or potential issue, you can ask it to fix it by commenting on the pull request with a follow-up prompt like `@codex fix it`.

This will start a new cloud chat that will fix the issue and update the pull request.

## Define review guidance

To customize what Codex reviews, add a `## Code Review Rules` section to the
`AGENTS.md` closest to the code the rules govern. For example:

```md
## Code Review Rules

### Experiment cohorts

- Do not filter treatment comparisons on post-exposure behavior, including conversion or retention.
  Safe path: build cohorts from assignment or exposure; report conversion as an outcome.
```

Put repository-wide rules in the root `AGENTS.md` and service-specific rules
in a nested file. Keep rules concise, describe the behavior to flag and any
safe path or exception, and leave formatting and lint checks in CI. See
[Customize what Codex reviews](https://developers.openai.com/codex/third-party/github#customize-what-codex-reviews)
for setup and rule-writing guidance.
