# Run Codex Security in CI

> For the complete documentation index, see [llms.txt](https://learn.chatgpt.com/llms.txt). Markdown versions of documentation pages are available by appending `.md` to the page URL.

Run the Codex Security CLI in CI to review the exact changes in a pull request,
keep findings and coverage, and optionally fail the check at a chosen
severity. Start with advisory results, review scan quality and runtime, then
add a severity policy that fits your repository.

Install the public `@openai/codex-security` package. Running scans still
  requires Codex Security access.

This guide uses GitHub Actions. The same scan and export commands work in other
CI systems.

## Prepare the workflow

Store an OpenAI API key as a repository or organization secret named
`CODEX_SECURITY_API_KEY`.

Map this secret directly to the scan step's `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment
variable. Keep the credential scoped to the scan process and use
`--auth api-key` to select it explicitly.

The runner needs:

- Node.js 22 or later.
- Python 3.10 or later.
- The published `@openai/codex-security` package, installed outside the
  repository checkout.
- The pull-request head and base history so Git can calculate the merge base.
- [GitHub Code Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/integrating-with-code-scanning/uploading-a-sarif-file-to-github)
  enabled for private or internal repositories when you upload SARIF.

## Add the GitHub Actions workflow

Create `.github/workflows/codex-security.yml`. Before checking out the pull
request, install `@openai/codex-security@0.1.3` under
`$RUNNER_TEMP/codex-security` so the trusted executable is available at
`$RUNNER_TEMP/codex-security/node_modules/.bin/codex-security`:

```yaml

```

The workflow checks out the pull-request head, calculates its merge base, and
scans the committed changes between those revisions. Full history keeps the
target exact. `persist-credentials: false` keeps the repository token out of
the checked-out Git configuration. Installing the CLI before checkout and
running its absolute path keeps repository-controlled executables away from
the scan credential. `--auth api-key` explicitly selects the scoped API key.
The scan saves its history in a writable state directory outside the
repository.

`--json` writes one complete JSON document to stdout, so the workflow can save
it directly. Progress, completion summaries, and errors remain on stderr. This
differs from `codex exec --json`, which emits a JSON Lines event stream.

The export step reads a completed, sealed scan and writes SARIF. It leaves the
Codex runtime and credentials untouched. Scan artifacts can contain vulnerable
source snippets, evidence, and remediation details. Choose access controls and a
short retention window appropriate for your repository.

## Choose a severity policy

The above workflow is report-only because it omits `--fail-on-severity`.
Once you are ready to make findings affect the check, add a threshold to the
scan command:

```bash
"$CODEX_SECURITY_BIN" scan . \
  --diff origin/main \
  --output-dir /path/outside/repository/results \
  --fail-on-severity high
```

The supported thresholds are `critical`, `high`, `medium`, and `low`. A
threshold includes findings at that severity and above.

The scan step uses these exit codes:

| Exit  | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`   | The scan completed with complete coverage, and any configured policy passed.            |
| `1`   | The completed scan contains a finding at or above the threshold.                        |
| `2`   | The CLI found an input or runtime error, or the completed scan has incomplete coverage. |
| `130` | Ctrl-C interrupted the scan.                                                            |
| `143` | SIGTERM terminated the scan.                                                            |

A scan with `partial` or `unknown` coverage returns `2`, even without a severity
policy. The CLI still writes its available findings and coverage. Review the
deferred areas in `coverage.json` before treating the check as conclusive.

## Retry with an existing result directory

Use a fresh runner directory for each CI job. For a persistent or self-hosted
runner, preserve an earlier result with `--archive-existing`:

```bash
"$CODEX_SECURITY_BIN" scan . \
  --diff origin/main \
  --output-dir /path/outside/repository/results \
  --archive-existing
```

The command archives the earlier results and starts with an empty scan directory.

## Troubleshoot a CI scan

- **Unknown Git ref or unexpected diff:** Fetch the base and head history,
  calculate the merge base, and pass both revisions explicitly.
- **Protected or non-empty output directory:** Choose a private directory
  outside the enclosing Git worktree. Use `--archive-existing` when the
  directory already contains results.
- **Missing credentials:** Confirm the `CODEX_SECURITY_API_KEY` repository
  secret is available to the trusted workflow and mapped directly to the scan
  step's `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.
- **Scan history error:** Set `CODEX_SECURITY_STATE_DIR` to a writable
  directory outside the repository.
- **Python setup error:** Confirm that the runner uses Python 3.10 or later.
- **Incomplete coverage:** Review `coverage.json`, including deferred surfaces
  and open questions, then rerun with an appropriate target or environment.
- **SARIF export error:** Confirm that the scan completed and the full scan
  directory is available. Export validates the sealed artifacts before writing
  SARIF.
- **SARIF upload error:** For a private or internal repository, confirm that
  your organization turned on GitHub Code Security for the repository and the
  workflow grants `actions: read`, `contents: read`, and
  `security-events: write`.
