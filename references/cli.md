# Codex CLI

Codex CLI is OpenAI's coding agent that you can run locally from your terminal. It can read, change, and run code on your machine in the selected directory.
It's [open source](https://github.com/openai/codex) and built in Rust for speed and efficiency.

ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans include Codex. Learn more about [what's included](https://developers.openai.com/codex/pricing).

## CLI setup

The Codex CLI is available on macOS, Windows, and Linux. On Windows, run Codex
  natively in PowerShell with the Windows sandbox, or use WSL2 when you need a
  Linux-native environment. For setup details, see the
  [Windows setup guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/windows).

If you're new to Codex, read the [best practices guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/learn/best-practices).

### Control model and reasoning

Use `/model` to switch between GPT-5.4, GPT-5.3-Codex, and other available models, or adjust reasoning levels.

### Image inputs

Attach screenshots or design specs so Codex reads them alongside your prompt.

### Image generation

Generate or edit images directly in the CLI, and attach references when you want Codex to iterate on an existing asset.

### Run local code review

Get your code reviewed by a separate Codex agent before you commit or push your changes.

### Use subagents

Use subagents to parallelize complex tasks.

### Web search

Use Codex to search the web and get up-to-date information for your task.

### Codex Cloud tasks

Launch a Codex Cloud task, choose environments, and apply the resulting diffs without leaving your terminal.

### Scripting Codex

Automate repeatable workflows by scripting Codex with the `exec` command.

### Model Context Protocol
